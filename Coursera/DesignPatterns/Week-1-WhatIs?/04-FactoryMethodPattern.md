# Factory method pattern

## Factory object pattern
- Having a new class a factory creating a product object for
## Factory function pattern
- Having a factory method in the class for creating a product object for
- Using abstract super class
- Subclasses has to override the factory method
## Point:
- Creating customized objects => product objects
- If multiple clients creates a type of objects from call A modifying the class A does not require to change those clients. The factory can take care of the customization.
- No need to have a init function with a large number of params or overload a function a lot of times
