# Proxy pattern

Proxy class act as a simplifyed version of the original subject class

# Why?
- Sensitive information in subject  (protection proxy)
- Subject class is more resource heavy to instantiate (virtual proxy) (used for images for example)
- The subject class is remote (remote proxy)


# Steps
- Design Subject interface
- Implement real subject class
- Implement the proxy class
